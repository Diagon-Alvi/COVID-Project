# COVID-Project
Project for my portfolio examining world-wide COVID data.
I uploaded a few queries using code from Google's BigQuery. It takes a look into multiple variables including countries' varying mortality count, vaccination rates, and even continent based analyses. 
I later used this data to create a basic tableau dashboard at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alvi.h/viz/March2023COVIDDataDashboardProject/Dashboard3?publish=yes
